  description: After the humans had lost the protection of their gods and the demons
    now rage in their world and cause destruction, most of them let themselves be
    guided by their anger and desperation. They fight everything that can cause them
    suffering. They do not shy away from gods and want to take revenge on them for
    abandoning them.
