  description: An amphibious water goblin, a mixture of turtle and man. These simultaneously
    frog-like creatures have a preference for blood, which they suck from their victims
    they drag from the shore into the water. The strength needed for this is drawn
    from the water in the hollow on its head. Surprisingly, these vicious ones love
    cucumbers and sumo wrestling as well as human and animal blood.
