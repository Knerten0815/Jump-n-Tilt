  description: "One day the gods came down from heaven and cleansed the hostile land
    so that the humans could prosper. Once the work was done most of the gods ascended
    back into the heavenly planes. But as the strongest amongst all gods Kashima
    failed his task to defeat the immortal \u014Cnamazu once and for all, it was
    his holy duty to at least prevent it from causing more earthquakes. So he remained
    in the earthen realm guarding the catfish ever since."
