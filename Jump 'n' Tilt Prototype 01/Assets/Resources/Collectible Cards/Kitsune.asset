  title: Kitsune
  description: Kitsune are supernatural mythical creatures in the shape of a fox.
    They are shape-shifters and messengers of good luck to the gods. But not everyone
    has good intentions. Like the Nogitsune, the evil race of those mystical fox
    spirits. They are deceitful and malicious and enjoy driving people mad. But what
    makes Kitsune special is the number of their tails, which give them power. The
    older they are, the more they grow. With nine tails they have reached their maximum
    power.
