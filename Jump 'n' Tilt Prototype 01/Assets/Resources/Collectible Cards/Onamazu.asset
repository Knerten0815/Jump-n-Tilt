  description: "Although \u014Cnamazu knows no good nor evil, its every move causes
    catastrophic earthquakes. And it\u2019s just its nature to fidget and flounder,
    which is why it had to be dealt with, when the gods pacified the earth. The god
    Kashima was sent to kill the catfish, but since it is immortal, he buried it
    beneath a giant rock rendering it motionless. No one knows how old this strange
    entity is, not even itself."
