  title: Onyro
  description: Vengeful spirits, forcibly torn from their lives, their thirst for
    revenge unquenched. These are Onryo. These deceased souls were denied their revenge
    by death, which is why they cannot rest in peace, and why they haunt the world
    of the living in rage. They especially curse their human enemies. They torture
    them and cause suffering. Even when their soul has found rest, their curses remain
    for years.
