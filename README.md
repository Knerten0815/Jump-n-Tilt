# Kashima
Long ago the giant catfish Onamazu was feared for causing horrible eathquakes whenever it moved. The mighty god Kashima pacified the land from this threat, by pinning down the fish with a massive boulder and guarding it ever since. Now, centuries later, the boulder has been shattered and the catfish is set free again. Take on the role of Kashima and find out who caused this heresy.
